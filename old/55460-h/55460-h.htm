<h2>VICTORIA CASTLE, KILLINEY, COUNTY OF DUBLIN.</h2>

<p>Our metropolitan readers, at least, and many others besides,
are aware of the magnificent but not easily to be realised
project, recently propounded, of erecting a town on the east
side of Malpas’s or Killiney Hill&mdash;a situation certainly of
unrivalled beauty and grandeur. Plans, most satisfactory,
and views prospective as well as perspective of this as yet
non-existent Brighton or Clifton, have been laid before the
public, with a view to obtain the necessary ways and means to
give it a more substantial reality; but alas! for the uncertainty
of human wishes! Queenstown, despite the popularity
of our sovereign, is not likely, for some time at least, to
present a rivalry, in any thing but its romantic and commanding
site, to the busy, bustling, and not very symmetrically
built town which has been erected in honour of Her
august eldest uncle. The good people of Kingstown may
therefore rejoice; their glory will not for some time at least
be eclipsed; and the lovers of natural romantic scenery who
have not money&mdash;they seldom have&mdash;to employ in promising
speculations, may also rejoice, for the wild and precipitous
cliffs of Killiney are likely to retain for some years longer a
portion of their romantic beauty; the rocks will not be shaped
into well-dressed forms of prim gentility; the purple heather and
blossomy furze, “unprofitable gay,” may give nature’s brilliant
colouring to the scenery, and the wild sea-birds may sport
around: the time has not arrived when they will be destroyed or
banished from their ancient haunt by the encroachment of man.</p>

<p>But however this may be, the first stone of the new town
has been laid; nay, the first building&mdash;no less a building than
“Victoria Castle”&mdash;has been actually erected; and, as a memorial
of one of the gigantic projects of this speculating nineteenth
century of ours, we have felt it incumbent on us to
give its fair proportions a place in our immortal and universally
read miscellany, in order to hand down its pristine form to
posterity in ages when it shall have been shaped by time into
a genuine antique ruin.</p>

<p>Of the architectural style and general appearance of Victoria
Castle, our engraving gives a good idea. Like most
modern would-be castles, it has towers and crenellated battlements
and <em>large</em> windows in abundance, and is upon the
whole as unlike a real old castle as such structures usually
are. It is, however, a picturesque and imposing structure of
its kind, and, what is of more consequence to its future occupants,
a cheerful and commodious habitation, which is more
than can be said of most genuine castles, or of many more
classical imitations of them; and its situation, on a terrace on
the south side of Killiney Hill, is one as commanding and
beautiful as could possibly be imagined.</p>

<p>Nothing in nature can indeed surpass the beauty, variety,
and extent of the prospects which may be enjoyed from this
spot or its immediate vicinity, and we might fill a whole
number of our Journal in describing their principal features.
To most of our readers, however, they must be already familiar,
and to those who have not had the pleasure of enjoying
a sight of them, it will convey a sufficient general idea of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
they must be, to acquaint them that Killiney Hill from the
same point commands, towards the west, views of the far-famed
Bay of Dublin, the city, and the richly-cultivated and
villa-studded plains by which it is surrounded, towards the
north, the bold, rugged promontory of Howth, with the
islands of Dalkey, Ireland’s eye, Lambay, and the peaked
mountain-ranges of Down and Lowth in the extreme distance;
and lastly, towards the east and south, the sea, and the lovely
Bay of Killiney, with its shining yellow strand, curved into
the form of a spacious and magnificent amphitheatre, from
which, as in seats above each other, ascend the richly-wooded
hills, backed by the mountains of Dublin and Wicklow, with
all their exquisite variety of forms and fitful changes of colour.
In short, it may truly be said of this delightful situation, that
though other localities may possess some individual character
of scenery of greater beauty or grandeur, there are few if
any in the British empire that could fairly be compared with
it for its variety and general interest.</p>

<p>Of the great interest of Killiney to the naturalist, and the
geologist more particularly, we have already endeavoured to
give our readers some notion in a paper, in a recent number,
from the pen of our able and accomplished friend Dr Schouler;
and Killiney is scarcely less interesting to the antiquary than
to the man of science. Though till a recent period its now
cultivated and thickly inhabited hills and shores presented the
virgin appearance of a country nearly in the state which nature
left it, the numerous monuments of antiquity scattered about
them clearly evinced that man had been a wanderer if not
an inhabitant here in the most remote times. Numerous
kistvaens containing human skeletons have been found between
the road and the sea, undoubtedly of pagan times; and
we have ourselves seen in our young days six very large
urns of baked clay, containing burned bones, which were
discovered in sinking the foundations for a cottage, near the
road between the Killiney and Rochestown hills. We have
also seen several sepulchral stone circles, now no longer
remaining; and there is yet to be seen of the same period, a
fine cromleac, situated near Shanganagh, and that most remarkable
and interesting pagan temple, near the Martello
tower, with its judgment chair, and the figures of the sun and
moon sculptured on one of the stones within its enclosure.
Nor is Killiney without its monument of Christian piety of as
early date as any to be found in Ireland. In the beautiful ivied
ruin of its parish church, the antiquary may enjoy a sight
of one of the most characteristic examples of the temples
erected by the Irish immediately after their conversion to
Christianity, and make himself intimate with a style of architecture
not now to be found in other portions of the British
empire.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE CASTLE OF AUGHENTAIN, OR A LEGEND OF THE BROWN GOAT,<br />
<span class="smaller">A TALE OF TOM GRASSIEY, THE SHANAHUS.</span></h2>

<p class="center">BY WILLIAM CARLETON.</p>

<p>When Tom had expressed an intention of relating an old
story, the hum of general conversation gradually subsided
into silence, and every face assumed an expression of curiosity
and interest, with the exception of Jemsy Baccagh, who was
rather deaf, and blind George M’Givor, so called because he
wanted an eye; both of whom, in high and piercing tones,
carried on an angry discussion touching a small law-suit that
had gone against Jemsy in the Court Leet, of which George
was a kind of rustic attorney. An outburst of impatient rebuke
was immediately poured upon them from fifty voices.
“Whisht with yez, ye pair of devils’ limbs, an’ Tom goin’
to tell us a story. Jemsy, your sowl’s as crooked as your lame
leg, you sinner; an’ as for blind George, if roguery would save
a man, he’d escape the devil yet. Tarenation to yez, an’ be
quiet till we hear the story!”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Tom, “Scripthur says that when the blind leads
the blind, both will fall into the ditch; but God help the lame
that have blind George to lead them; we might aisily guess
where he’d guide them to, especially such a poor innocent as
Jemsy there.” This banter, as it was not intended to give
offence, so was it received by the parties to whom it was addressed
with laughter and good humour.</p>

<p>“Silence, boys,” said Tom; “I’ll jist take a draw of the pipe
till I put my mind in a proper state of transmigration for
what I’m goin’ to narrate.”</p>

<p>He then smoked on for a few minutes, his eyes complacently
but meditatively closed, and his whole face composed into the
philosophic spirit of a man who knew and felt his own superiority,
as well as what was expected from him. When he
had sufficiently arranged the materials in his mind, he took the
pipe out of his mouth, rubbed the shank-end of it against the
cuff of his coat, then handed it to his next neighbour, and
having given a short preparatory cough, thus commenced his
legend:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You must know that afther Charles the First happened to
miss his head one day, havin’ lost it while playin’ a game of
‘Heads an’ Points’ with the Scotch, that a man called Nolly
Rednose, or Oliver Crummle, was sent over to Ireland with a
parcel of breekless Highlanders an’ English Bodaghs to subduvate
the Irish, an’ as many of the Prodestans as had been
friends to the late king, who were called Royalists. Now,
it appears by many larned transfigurations that Nolly Rednose
had in his army a man named Balgruntie, or the Hog of
Cupar; a fellow who was as coorse as sackin’, as cunnin’ as
a fox, an’ as gross as the swine he was named afther. Rednose,
there is no doubt of it, was as nate a hand at takin’ a
town or castle as ever went about it; but then, any town that
didn’t surrendher at discretion was sure to experience little
mitigation at his hands; an’ whenever he was bent on wickedness,
he was sure to say his prayers at the commencement of
every siege or battle; that is, he intended to show no marcy
in, for he’d get a book, an’ openin’ it at the head of his army,
he’d cry, ‘Ahem, my brethren, let us praise God by endeavourin’
till sing sich or sich a psalm;’ an’ God help the man,
woman, or child, that came before him after that. Well an’
good: it so happened that a squadron of his psalm-singers
were dispatched by him from Enniskillen, where he stopped to
rendher assistance to a part of his army that O’Neill was
leatherin’ down near Dungannon, an’ on their way they happened
to take up their quarthers for the night at the Mill of
Aughentain. Now, above all men in the creation, who should
be appointed to lead this same squadron but the Hog of Cupar.
‘Balgruntie, go off wid you,’ said Crummle, when administering
his instructions to him; ‘but be sure that wherever you
meet a fat royalist on the way, to pay your respects to him as
a Christian ought,’ says he; ‘an’, above all things, my dear
brother Balgruntie, <em>don’t neglect your devotions</em>, otherwise
our arms can’t prosper; and be sure,’ says he, with a pious
smile, ‘that if they promulgate opposition, you will make them
bleed anyhow, either in purse or person; or if they provoke the
grace o’ God, take a little from them in both; an’ so the Lord’s
name be praised, yeamen!’</p>

<p>Balgruntie sang a psalm of thanksgivin’ for bein’ elected by
his commander to sich a holy office, set out on his march, an’
the next night he an’ his choir slep in the mill of Aughentain,
as I said. Now, Balgruntie had in this same congregation of
his a long-legged Scotchman named Sandy Saveall, which name
he got by way of etymology, for his charity; for it appears by
the historical elucidations that Sandy was perpetually rantinizin’
about sistherly affection an’ brotherly love: an’ what
showed more taciturnity than any thing else was, that while
this same Sandy had the persuasion to make every one believe
that he thought of nothing else, he shot more people than any
ten men in the squadron. He was indeed what they call a
dead shot, for no one ever knew him to miss any thing he fired
at. He had a musket that could throw point blank an English
mile, an’ if he only saw a man’s nose at that distance, he
used to say that with aid from above he could blow it for
him with a leaden handkerchy, meaning that he could blow it
off his face with a musket bullet; and so by all associations he
could, for indeed the faits he performed were very insinivating
an’ problematical.</p>

<p>Now, it so happened that at this period there lived in the
castle a fine wealthy ould royalist, named Graham or Grimes,
as they are often denominated, who had but one child, a
daughter, whose beauty an’ perfections were mellifluous far
an’ near over the country, an’ who had her health drunk, as
the toast of Ireland, by the Lord Lieutenant in the Castle of
Dublin, undher the sympathetic appellation of ‘the Rose of
Aughentain.’ It was her son that afterwards ran through the
estate, and was forced to part wid the castle; an’ it’s to him
the proverb colludes, which mentions ‘ould John Grame, that
swallowed the castle of Aughentain.’</p>

<p>Howsomever, that bears no prodigality to the story I’m
narratin’. So what would you have of it, but Balgruntie,
who had heard of the father’s wealth and the daughter’s
beauty, took a holy hankerin’ afther both; an’ havin’ as usual
said his prayers an’ sung a psalm, he determined for to clap
his thumb upon the father’s money, thinkin’ that the daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
would be the more aisily superinduced to folly it. In other
words, he made up his mind to sack the castle, carry off the
daughter and marry her righteously, rather, he said, through
a sincere wish to bring her into a state of grace, by a union
with a God-fearin’ man, whose walk he trusted was Zionward,
than from any cardinal detachment for her wealth or beauty.
He accordingly sent up a file of the most pious men he had,
picked fellows, with good psalm-singin’ voices and strong noses,
to request that John Graham would give them possession of
the castle for a time, an’ afterwards join them at prayers, as
a proof that he was no royalist, but a friend to Crummle an’
the Commonwealth. Now, you see, the best of it was, that
the very man they demanded this from was commonly denominated
by the people as ‘Gunpowdher Jack,’ in consequence
of the great signification of his courage; an’, besides, he was
known to be a member of the Hell-fire Club, that no person
could join that hadn’t fought three duels, and killed at
least one man; and in ordher to show that they regarded
neither God nor hell, they were obligated to dip one hand in
blood an’ the other in fire, before they could be made members
of the club. It’s aisy to see, then, that Graham was not likely
to quail before a handful of the very men he hated wid all the
vociferation in his power, an’ he accordingly put his head out
of the windy, an’ axed them their tergiversation for bein’ there.</p>

<p>‘Begone about your business,’ he said; ‘I owe you no regard.
What brings you before the castle of a man who despises
you? Don’t think to determinate me, you cauting rascals,
for you can’t. My castle’s well provided wid men, an’
ammunition, an’ food; an’ if you don’t be off, I’ll make you
sing a different tune from a psalm one.’ Begad he did, plump
to them, out of the windy.</p>

<p>When Crummle’s men returned to Balgruntie in the mill,
they related what had tuck place, an’ he said that afther
prayers he’d send a second message in writin’, an’ if it wasn’t
attended to, they’d put their trust in God an’ storm the
castle. The squadron he commanded was not a numerous
one; an’ as they had no artillery, an’ were surrounded by enemies,
the takin’ of the castle, which was a strong one, might
cost them some snufflication. At all events, Balgruntie was
bent on makin’ the attempt, especially afther he heard that the
castle was well vittled, an’ indeed he was meritoriously joined
by his men, who piously licked their lips on hearin’ of such
glad tidings. Graham was a hot-headed man, without much
ambidexterity or deliberation, otherwise he might have known
that the bare mintion of the beef an’ mutton in his castle was
only fit to make such a hungry pack desperate. But be that
as it may, in a short time Balgruntie wrote him a letter, demandin’
of him, in the name of Nolly Rednose an’ the Commonwealth,
to surrendher the castle, or if not, that, ould as he
was, he would make him as soople as a two-year-ould. Graham,
afther readin’ it, threw the letther back to the messengers
wid a certain recommendation to Balgruntie regardin’ it;
but whether the same recommendation was followed up an’
acted on so soon as he wished, historical retaliations do not
inform.</p>

<p>On their return the military narrated to their commander
the reception they resaved a second time from Graham, an’
he then resolved to lay regular siege to the castle; but as he
knew he could not readily take it by violence, he determined,
as they say, to starve the garrison leisurely an’ by degrees.
But, first an’ foremost, a thought struck him, an’ he immediently
called Sandy Saveall behind the mill-hopper, which he
had now turned into a pulpit for the purpose of expoundin’ the
word, an’ givin’ exhortations to his men.</p>

<p>‘Sandy,’ said he, ‘are you in a state of justification to-day?’</p>

<p>‘Towards noon,’ replied Sandy, ‘I had some strong wristlings
with the enemy; but I am able, undher praise, to say that
I defated him in three attacks, and I consequently feel my
righteousness much recruited. I had some wholesome communings
with the miller’s daughter, a comely lass, who may
yet be recovered from the world, an’ led out of the darkness
of Aigyp, by a word in saison.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Sandy,’ replied the other, ‘I lave her to your own
instructions; there is another poor benighted maiden, who is
also comely, up in the castle of that godless sinner, who belongeth
to the Perdition Club; an’, indeed, Sandy, until he is somehow
removed, I think there is little hope of plucking her like
a brand out of the burning.’</p>

<p>He serenaded Sandy in the face as he spoke, an’ then cast
an extemporary glance at the musket, which was as much as
to say ‘can you translate an insinivation?’ Sandy concocted
a smilin’ reply; an’ takin’ up the gun, rubbed the barrel, an’
pattin’ it as a sportsman would pat the neck of his horse or
dog, wid reverence for comparin’ the villain to either one or
the other.</p>

<p>‘If it was known, Sandy,’ said Balgruntie, ‘it would harden
her heart against me; an’ as he is hopeless at all events, bein’
a member of that Perdition Club’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘True,’ said Sandy, ‘but you lave the miller’s daughter to
me?’</p>

<p>‘I said so.’</p>

<p>‘Well, if his removal will give you any consolidation in the
matther, you may say no more.’</p>

<p>‘I could not, Sandy, justify it to myself to take him away by
open violence, for you know that I bear a conscience if any
thing too tendher and dissolute. Also I wish, Sandy, to presarve
an ondeniable reputation for humanity; an’, besides, the
daughter might become as reprobate as the father if she suspected
me to be personally concarned in it. I have heard a
good deal about him, an’ am sensibly informed that he has
been shot at twice before, by the sons, it is thought, of an
enemy that he himself killed rather significantly in a duel.’</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ replied Sandy; ‘I would myself feel scruples;
but as both our consciences is touched in the business, I think
I am justified. Indeed, captain, it is very likely afther all
that we are but the mere instruments in it, an’ that it is
through us that this ould unrighteous sinner is to be removed
by a more transplendant judgment.’</p>

<p>Begad, neighbours, when a rascal is bent on wickedness,
it is aisy to find cogitations enough to back him in his villany.
And so was it with Sandy Saveall and Balgruntie.</p>

<p>That evenin’ ould Graham was shot through the head standin’
in the windy of his own castle, an’ to extenuate the suspicion
of sich an act from Crummle’s men, Balgruntie himself went
up the next day, beggin’ very politely to have a friendly explanation
with Squire Graham, sayin’ that he had harsh ordhers,
but that if the castle was peaceably delivered to him, he would,
for the sake of the young lady, see that no injury should be
offered either to her or her father.</p>

<p>The young lady, however, had the high drop in her, and
becoorse the only answer he got was a flag of defiance. This
nettled the villain, an’ he found there was nothin’ else for it
but to plant a strong guard about the castle to keep all that
was in, in&mdash;and all that was out, out.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the very appearance of the Crumwellians
in the neighbourhood struck such terror into the people, that
the country, which was then only very thinly inhabited, became
quite desarted, an’ for miles about the face of a human bein’
could not be seen, barrin’ their own, sich as they were. Crummle’s
track was always a bloody one, an’ the people knew
that they were wise in puttin’ the hills an’ mountain passes
between him an’ them. The miller an’ his daughter bein’ encouraged
by Sandy, staid principally for the sake of Miss
Graham; but except them, there was not a man or woman in
the barony to bid good-morrow to or say Salvey Dominey.
On the beginnin’ of the third day, Balgruntie, who knew his
officialities extremely well, an’ had sent down a messenger to
Dungannon to see whether matters were so bad as they had
been reported, was delighted to hear that O’Neill had disappeared
from the neighbourhood. He immediately informed
Crummle of this, and tould him that he had laid siege to one
of the leadin’ passes of the north, an’ that, by gettin’ possession
of the two castles of Aughentain and Augher, he could
keep O’Neill in check, and command that part of the country.
Nolly approved of this, an’ ordhered him to proceed, but was
sorry that he could send him no assistance at present;
‘however,’ said he, ‘with a good cause, sharp swords, an’ aid
from above, there is no fear of us.’</p>

<p>They now set themselves to take the castle in airnest.
Balgruntie an’ Sandy undherstood one another, an’ not a day
passed that some one wasn’t dropped in it. As soon as ever
a face appeared, pop went the deadly musket, an’ down fell
the corpse of whoever it was aimed at. Miss Graham herself
was spared for good reasons, but in the coorse of ten or
twelve days she was nearly alone. Ould Graham, though a
man that feared nothing, was only guilty of a profound swagger
when he reported the strength of the castle and the state
of the provisions to Balgruntie an’ his crew. But above all
things, that which eclipsed their distresses was the want of
wather. There was none in the castle, an’ although there is
a beautiful well beside it, yet, <em>farcer gair</em>, it was of small responsibility
to them. Here, then, was the poor young lady
placed at the marcy of her father’s murdherer; for however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
she might have doubted in the beginnin’ that he was shot by
the Crumwellians, yet the death of nearly all the servants of
the house in the same way was a sufficient proof that it was
like masther like man in this case. What, however, was to be
done? The whole garrison now consisted only of Miss Graham
herself, a fat man cook advanced in years, who danced
in his distress in ordher that he might suck his own perspiration,
and a little orphan boy that she tuck undher her purtection.
It was a hard case, an’ yet, God bless her, she held out
like a man.</p>

<p>It’s an ould sayin’ that there’s no tyin’ up the tongue of
Fame, an’ it’s also a true one. The account of the siege had
gone far an’ near in the counthry, an’ none of the Irish, no
matter what they were who ever heard it, but wor sorry.
Sandy Saveall was now the devil an’ all. As there was no
more in the castle to shoot, he should find something to regenerate
his hand upon: for instance, he practised upon three or
four of Graham’s friends, who undher one pretence or other
were seen skulkin’ about the castle, an’ none of their relations
durst come to take away their bodies in ordher to bury them.
At length things came to that pass, that poor Miss Graham
was at the last gasp for something to drink; she had ferreted
out as well as she could a drop of moisture here an’
there in the damp corners of the castle, but now all that was
gone; the fat cook had sucked himself to death, and the little
orphan boy died calmly away a few hours afther him, lavin’
the helpless lady with a tongue swelled an’ furred, and a
mouth parched and burned, for want of drink. Still the blood
of the Grahams was in her, and yield she would not to the
villain that left her as she was. Sich then was the transparency
of her situation, when happening to be on the battlements
to catch, if possible, a little of the dew of heaven, she
was surprised to see something flung up, which rolled down
towards her feet; she lifted it, an’ on examinin’ the contents,
found it to be a stone covered with a piece of brown
paper, inside which was a slip of white, containing the
words, ‘Endure&mdash;relief is near you!’ But, poor young lady,
of what retrospection could these tidings be to one in her situation?&mdash;she
could scarcely see to read them; her brain was
dizzy, her mouth like a cindher, her tongue swelled an’ black,
an’ her breath felt as hot as a furnace. She could barely
breathe, an’ was in the very act of lyin’ down undher the triumphant
air of heaven to die, when she heard the shrill voice
of a young kid in the castle yard, and immediently remembered
that a brown goat which her lover, a gentleman named Simpson,
had, when it was a kid, made her a present of, remained
in the castle about the stable during the whole siege. She
instantly made her way slowly down stairs, got a bowl, and
havin’ milked the goat, she took a little of the milk, which I
need not asseverate at once relieved her. By this means she
recovered, an’ findin’ no further anticipation from druth, she
resolved like a hairo to keep the Crumwellians out, an’ to
wait till either God or man might lend her a helpin’ hand.</p>

<p>Now, you must know that the miller’s purty daughter had
also a sweetheart called <em>Suil Gair</em> Maguire, or sharp-eye’d
Maguire, an humble branch of the great Maguires of Enniskillen;
an’ this same Suil Gair was servant an’ foster-brother
to Simpson, who was the intended husband of Miss Graham.
Simpson, who lived some miles off, on hearin’ the condition of
the castle, gathered together all the royalists far an’ near;
an’ as Crummle was honestly hated by both Romans an’
Prodestans, faith, you see, Maguire himself promised to send
a few of his followers to the rescue. In the mean time, Suil
Gair dressed himself up like a fool or idiot, an’ undher the
protection of the miller’s daughter, who blarnied Saveall in
great style, was allowed to wandher about an’ joke wid the
sogers; but especially he took a fancy to Sandy, and challenged
him to put one stone out of five in one of the port-holes
of the castle, at a match of finger-stone. Sandy, who was
nearly as famous at that as the musket, was rather relaxed
when he saw that Suil Gair could at least put in every second
stone, an’ that he himself could hardly put one in out of
twenty. Well, at all events it was durin’ their sport that
fool Paddy, as they called him, contrived to fling the scrap
of writin’ I spoke of across the battlements at all chances; for
when he undhertook to go to the castle, he gave up his life as
lost; but he didn’t care about that, set in case he was able to
save either his foster-brother or Miss Graham. But this is
not at all indispensable, for it is well known that many a foster-brother
sacrificed his life the same way, and in cases of
great danger, when the real brother would beg to decline the
compliment.</p>

<p>Things were now in a very connubial state entirely. Balgruntie
heard that relief was comin’ to the castle, an’ what
to do he did not know; there was little time to be lost, however,
an’ something must be done. He praiched flowery discourses
twice a-day from the mill-hopper, an’ sang psalms for
grace to be directed in his righteous intentions; but as yet
he derived no particular predilection from either. Sandy appeared
to have got a more bountiful modelum of grace than
his captain, for he succeeded at last in bringin’ the miller’s
daughter to sit undher the word at her father’s hopper. Fool
Paddy, as they called Maguire, had now become a great favourite
wid the sogers, an’ as he proved to be quite harmless
and inoffensive, they let him run about the place widout opposition.
The castle, to be sure, was still guarded, but Miss
Graham kept her heart up in consequence of the note, for she
hoped every day to get relief from her friends. Balgruntie,
now seein’ that the miller’s daughter was becomin’ more
serious undher the taichin’ of Saveall, formed a plan that he
thought might enable him to penethrate the castle, an’ bear
off the lady an’ the money. This was to strive wid very delicate
meditation to prevail on the miller’s daughter, through
the renown that he thought Sandy had over her, to open a
correspondency wid Miss Graham; for he knew that if one of
the gates was unlocked, and the unsuspectin’ girl let in, the
whole squadron would soon be in afther her. Now, this plan
was the more dangerous to Miss Graham, because the miller’s
daughter had intended to bring about the very same denouncement
for a different purpose. Between her friend an’
her enemies it was clear the poor lady had little chance; an’
it was Balgruntie’s intention, the moment he had sequestrated
her and the money, to make his escape, an’ lave the castle to
whosomever might choose to take it. Things, however, were
ordhered to take a different bereavement: the Hog of Cupar
was to be trapped in the hydrostatics of his own hypocrisy,
an’ Saveall to be overmatched in his own premises. Well,
the plot was mentioned to Sandy, who was promised a good
sketch of the prog; an’ as it was jist the very thing he dreamt
about night an’ day, he snapped at it as a hungry dog would
at a sheep’s trotter. That night the miller’s daughter&mdash;whose
name I may as well say was Nannie Duffy, the purtiest girl
an’ the sweetest singer that ever was in the counthry&mdash;was to
go to the castle an’ tell Miss Graham that the sogers wor all
gone, Crummle killed, an’ his whole army massacrayed to
atoms. This was a different plan from poor Nannie’s, who
now saw clearly what they were at. But never heed a woman
for bein’ witty when hard pushed.</p>

<p>‘I don’t like to do it,’ said she, ‘for it looks like thrachery,
espishilly as my father has left the neighbourhood, and I don’t
know where he is gone to; an’ you know thrachery’s ondacent
in either man or woman. Still, Sandy, it goes hard for
me to refuse one that I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;well, I wish I knew where my
father is&mdash;I would like to know what he’d think of it.’</p>

<p>‘Hut,’ said Sandy, ‘where’s the use of such scruples in a
good cause?&mdash;when we get the money, we’ll fly. It is principally
for the sake of waining you an’ her from the darkness of
idolatry that we do it. Indeed, my conscience would not rest
well if I let a soul an’ body like yours remain a prey to Sathan,
my darlin’.’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said she, ‘doesn’t the captain exhort this evenin’?’</p>

<p>‘He does, my beloved, an’ with a blessin’ will expound a
few verses from the Song of Solomon.’</p>

<p>‘It’s betther then,’ said she, ‘to sit under the word, an’
perhaps some light may be given to us.’</p>

<p>This delighted Saveall’s heart, who now looked upon pretty
Nannie as his own; indeed, he was obliged to go gradually
and cautiously to work, for cruel though Nolly Rednose was,
Sandy knew that if any violent act of that kind should raich
him, the guilty party would sup sorrow. Well, accordin’ to
this pious arrangement, Balgruntie assembled all his men who
were not on duty about the hopper, in which he stood as
usual, an’ had commenced a powerful exhortation, the substratum
of which was devoted to Nannie; he dwelt upon the
happiness of religious love; said that scruples were often suggested
by Satan, an’ that a heavenly duty was but terrestrial
when put in comparishment wid an earthly one. He also made
collusion to the old Squire that was popped by Sandy; said
it was often a judgment for the wicked man to die in his sins;
an’ was gettin’ on wid great eloquence an’ emulation, when a
low rumblin’ noise was heard, an’ Balgruntie, throwin’ up his
clenched hands an’ grindin’ his teeth, shouted out, ‘Hell and
d&mdash;&mdash;n, I’ll be ground to death! The mill’s goin’ on!
Murdher! murdher! I’m gone!’ Faith, it was true enough&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
had been wickedly set a-goin’ by some one; an’ before
they had time to stop her, the Hog of Cupar had the feet and
legs twisted off him before their eyes&mdash;a fair illustration of
his own doctrine, that it is often a judgment for the wicked
man to die in his sins. When the mill was stopped, he was
pulled out, but didn’t live twenty minutes, in consequence of
the loss of blood. Time was pressin’, so they ran up a shell of a
coffin, and tumbled it into a pit that was hastily dug for it on
the mill-common.</p>

<p>This, however, by no manner of manes relieved poor Nannie
from her difficulty, for Saveall, finding himself now first
in command, determined not to lose a moment in tolerating
his plan upon the castle.</p>

<p>‘You see,’ said he, ‘that a way is opened for us that we
didn’t expect; an’ let us not close our eyes to the light that
has been given, lest it might be suddenly taken from us again.
In this instance I suspect that fool Paddy has been made the
chosen instrument; for it appears upon inquiry that he too
has disappeared. However, heaven’s will be done! we will
have the more to ourselves, my beloved&mdash;ehem! It is now
dark,’ he proceeded, ‘so I shall go an’ take my usual smoke
at the mill window, an’ in about a quarther of an hour I’ll be
ready.’</p>

<p>‘But I’m all in a tremor after sich a frightful accident,’
replied Nannie: ‘an’ I want to get a few minutes’ quiet before
we engage upon our undhertakin.’</p>

<p>This was very natural, and Saveall accordingly took his
usual seat at a little windy in the gable of the mill, that faced
the miller’s house; an’ from the way the bench was fixed, he
was obliged to sit with his face exactly towards the same direction.
There we leave him meditatin’ upon his own righteous
approximations, till we folly <em>Suil Gair</em> Maguire, or fool
Paddy, as they called him, who practicated all that was done.</p>

<p>Maguire and Nannie, findin’ that no time was to be lost, gave
all over as ruined, unless somethin’ could be acted on quickly.
Suil Gair at once thought of settin’ the mill a-goin’, but kept
the plan to himself, any further than tellin’ her not to be surprised
at any thing she might see. He then told her to steal
him a gun, but if possible to let it be Saveall’s, as he knew it
could be depended on. ‘But I hope you won’t shed any blood
if you can avoid it,’ said she; ‘<em>that</em> I don’t like.’ ‘Tut,’ replied
Suil Gair, makin’ evasion to the question, ‘it’s good to have
it about me for my own defence.’</p>

<p>He could often have shot either Balgruntie or Saveall in
daylight, but not without certain death to himself, as he knew
that escape was impossible. Besides, time was not before so
pressin’ upon them, an’ every day relief was expected. Now,
however, that relief was so near&mdash;for Simpson with a party of
royalists an’ Maguire’s men must be within a couple of hours’
journey&mdash;it would be too intrinsic entirely to see the castle
plundhered, and the lady carried off by such a long-legged
skyhill as Saveall. Nannie consequentially, at great risk,
took an opportunity of slipping his gun to Suil Gair, who was
the best shot of the day in that or any other part of the country;
and it was in consequence of this that he was called Suil
Gair, or Sharp Eye. But, indeed, all the Maguires were famous
shots; an’ I’m tould there’s one of them now in Dublin
that could hit a pigeon’s egg or a silver sixpence at the distance
of a hundred yards.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Suil Gair did not merely raise the
sluice when he set the mill a-goin’, but he whipped it out altogether
an’ threw it into the dam, so that the possibility of
saving the Hog of Cupar was irretrievable. He made off,
however, an’ threw himself among the tall ragweeds that grew
upon the common, till it got dark, when Saveall, as was his
custom, should take his evenin’ smoke at the windy. Here he
sat for some period, thinkin’ over many ruminations, before
he lit his cutty pipe, as he called it.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ said he to himself, ‘what is there to hindher me
from takin’ away, or rather from makin’ sure of the grand lassie,
instead of the miller’s daughter? If I get intil the castle,
it can be soon effected; for if she has any regard for her reputation,
she will be quiet. I’m a braw handsome lad enough,
a wee thought high in the cheek bones, scaly in the skin, an’
knock-knee’d a trifle, but stout an’ lathy, an’ tough as a
withy. But, again, what is to be done wi Nannie? Hut,
she’s but a miller’s daughter, an’ may be disposed of if she
gets troublesome. I know she’s fond of me, but I dinna blame
her for that. However, it wadna become me now to entertain
scruples, seein’ that the way is made so plain for me.
But, save us! eh, sirs, that was an awful death, an’ very like
a judgment on the Hog of Cupar! It is often a judgment for
the wicked to die in their sins! Balgruntie wasna that’&mdash;&mdash; Whatever
he intended to say further, cannot be analogized
by man, for, just as he had uttered the last word, which he did
while holding the candle to his pipe, the bullet of his own gun
entered between his eyes, and the next moment he was a corpse.</p>

<p>Suil Gair desarved the name he got, for truer did never
bullet go to the mark from Saveall’s own aim than it did from
his. There is now little more to be superadded to my story.
Before daybreak the next mornin’, Simpson came to the relief
of his intended wife; Crummle’s party war surprised, taken,
an’ cut to pieces; an’ it so happened that from that day to
this the face of a soger belongin’ to him was never seen near
the mill or castle of Aughentain, with one exception only, and
that was this:&mdash;You all know that the mill is often heard to go
at night when nobody sets her a-goin’, an’ that the most sevendable
scrames of torture come out of the hopper, an’ that when
any one has the courage to look in, they’re sure to see a man
dressed like a soger, with a white mealy face, in the act, so to
say, of havin’ his legs ground off him. Many a guess was
made about who the spirit could be, but all to no purpose.
There, however, is the truth for yez; the spirit that shrieks
in the hopper is Balgruntie’s ghost, an’ he’s to be ground that
way till the day of judgment.</p>

<p>Be coorse, Simpson and Miss Graham were married, as
war Nannie Duffy an’ Suil Gair; an’ if they all lived long an’
happy, I wish we may all live ten times longer an’ happier; an’
so we will, but in a betther world than this, plaise God.”</p>

<p>“Well, but, Tom,” said Gordon, “how does that account
for my name, which you said you’d tell me?”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Tom; “begad I was near forgettin’ it. Why,
you see, sich was their veneration for the goat that was the
manes, undher God, of savin’ Miss Graham’s life, that they
changed the name of Simpson to Gordon, which signifies in
Irish <i lang="ga">gor dhun</i>, or a brown goat, that all their posterity might
know the great obligations they lay undher to that reverend
animal.”</p>

<p>“An’ do you mane to tell me,” said Gordon, “that my name
was never heard of until Oliver Crummle’s time?”</p>

<p>“I do. Never in the wide an’ subterraneous earth was sich
a name known till afther the prognostication I tould you; an’
it never would either, only for the goat, sure. I can prove it
by the pathepathetics. Denny Mullin, will you give us another
draw o’ the pipe?”</p>

<p>Tom’s authority in these matters was unquestionable, and,
besides, there was no one present learned enough to contradict
him, with any chance of success, before such an audience.
The argument was consequently, without further discussion,
decided in his favour, and Gordon was silenced touching the
origin and etymology of his own name.</p>

<p>This legend we have related as nearly as we can remember
in Tom’s words. We may as well, however, state at once
that many of his legends were wofully deficient in authenticity,
as indeed those of most countries are. Nearly half the Irish
legends are <i lang="la">ex post facto</i> or <em>postliminious</em>. There is no record,
for instance, that Oliver Cromwell ever saw the castle of
Aughentain, or that any such event as that narrated by Tom
ever happened in or about it. It is much more likely that the
story, if ever there was any truth in it, is of Scotch origin, as
indeed the names would seem to import. There is no doubt,
however, that the castle of Aughentain, which is now in the
possession of a gentleman named Browne we think, was once
the property of a family called Graham. In our boyhood there
was a respectable family of that name living in its immediate
vicinity, but we know not whether they are the descendants of
those who owned the castle or not.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE HERRING.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Second Article.</span></h2>

<h3>THE FISHERY.</h3>

<p>Having given in a former number some account of the natural
history of this valuable little creature, we now proceed, in
accordance with our promise, to give a description of the
various modes of taking and curing it; and as the Dutch
were the first to see the importance, and devote themselves to
the improvement, of the herring fishery, we shall commence
with them.</p>

<p>So early as the year 1307, the Dutch had turned their attention
to this subject; and lest any of our more thoughtless
or less informed readers should deem the matter one of
secondary consideration, or probably of even less, we shall
lay before them some statistical accounts of the Dutch fisheries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
extracted from returns of the census of the States-General,
taken in the year 1669. In that year the total amount
of population was 2,400,000.</p>

<p>Thus nearly a fifth of the population of Holland was entirely
engaged in and supported by the herring and deep-sea
fishery, and thus arose the saying that “the foundations of
Amsterdam were laid on herring bones;” and hence did De
Witt assert that “Holland derived her main support from
the herring fishery, and that it ought to be considered as the
right arm of the republic.”</p>

<p>Before Holland was humbled upon the seas, and whilst she
was at the pinnacle of her prosperity, she had ten thousand
sail of shipping, with 168,000 mariners, afloat. Of these no
less than 6400 vessels, with 112,000 mariners, were employed
in and connected with the herring fishery alone, “although
the country itself affords them neither materials, nor victual,
nor merchandise, to be accounted of, towards their setting
forth.” When we come to the subject of curing, we shall take
occasion to point out the modes by which the Dutch attained
their excellence, and established this surprising trade; but at
present we have but to describe their manner of fishing.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Fishery</span> commences on the 24th of June,
and terminates on the 31st of December, and is carried on
in the latitudes of Shetland and Edinburgh, and on the coast
of Great Britain, with strong-decked vessels called busses,
manned by fourteen or fifteen men, and well supplied with
casks, salt, nets, and every material requisite for catching and
curing at sea. Each buss has generally fifty, and must not
have less than forty nets of 32 fathoms in length each, 8 fathoms
in depth, and a buoy-rope of 8 fathoms; an empty
barrel less than a herring barrel is attached to each buoy-rope.
This fleet of nets, as it is called, is divided by buoys into four
parts, by which their position is marked and their taking in
facilitated; the buoys at the extreme ends are painted white,
with the owners’ and vessels’ names upon them. By the
Dutch fishery laws it is provided that the yarn of the nets
must be of good unmixed Dutch or Baltic hemp, which must
be inspected before use by sworn surveyors; the yarn must
be well spun; and each full net, or fourth part of a fleet, must
be 740 meshes in length and 68 in depth, and the nets must
be inspected and marked before they can be used.</p>

<p>The Dutch always shoot their nets, that is, cast them into
the sea, at sunset, and take them in before sunrise. In shooting
them they cast them to windward, so that the wind may
prevent the vessel from coming upon them. The whole of the
nets are attached to four strong ropes joined to each other,
and are taken in by means of the capstan, to which four or
five men attend, whilst four more shake out the fish.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Small Fishery</span>, or fresh-herring fishery, is carried
on to the east of Yarmouth in deep water, with flat-bottomed
vessels without keels, so formed for the purpose of being run
ashore in any convenient place.</p>

<p>It is forbidden by the 15th and 16th articles of the Dutch
fishery laws to gut the herrings taken by the small fishery
either at sea or ashore, under pain of one month’s imprisonment,
and a fine of five guilders for every hundred herrings,
as well as the confiscation of the herrings, unless special permission
has been obtained from the king, at the request of the
States.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pan Fishery</span> is carried on in the rivers, inland seas,
and on the coast of Holland, within three miles of the shore.</p>

<p>The same prohibition, under similar penalties, that exists
against curing fish taken in the small fishery, extends to
this.</p>

<p>We have given the first place to the Dutch in this account,
in consequence of their having been the first to see the importance
of the fishery, but they take the lead no longer; the
English and Scotch have successfully rivalled them in curing,
and for the quantity taken during the season the Norwegians
surpass all others. The Norwegian is a wholesale fishery,
every description of ship and boat being in demand. They
have curing stations on shore, to which the boats bring the
fish as fast as they are caught; and there are large vessels
with barrels and salt lying out amongst the fishers, buying
from those who do not wish to lose time by going ashore. Every
description of net, as well as every sort of vessel, is in requisition;
some fishing at anchor, some sailing, and others hauling
their seines on shore, but the grand method is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>An immense range of nets with very small meshes so small
as to prevent the herrings from fastening in them, is extended
round a shoal of fish, and gradually moved towards some
creek or narrow inlet of the sea. The nets are drawn close
and made fast across the entrance, and the enormous body of
herrings thus crowded up into a narrow space is taken out
and cured at leisure. This mode of fishing is called a “lock.”</p>

<p>The following passage from a letter written by a gentleman
who witnessed the fishery near Hitteroe, to Mr Mitchell
of Leith, will give our readers some idea of its extent:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On the other side of the Sound we saw what is termed a
<em>lock</em>, that is, several nets joined together, forming a bar before
a small bay, into which the herrings were crowded. In this
place there were several thousand barrels of herrings, so compactly
confined together that an oar could stand up in the
mass. There were in the neighbourhood of Hitteroe altogether
about four or five thousand nets, and about two thousand
boats and vessels; and there were caught, according to
the opinion of several intelligent persons, this day (24th January
1833), not less than ten thousand barrels.”</p>

<p>The entire quantity taken on the coast of Norway during
the fall of 1832 and the spring of 1833 was estimated at
680,000 barrels, which was considered to be a fair average
take.</p>

<p>We come now to the home fishery, in which Yarmouth takes
the lead in the size of vessels and magnitude of tackle employed.
The fishing is carried on by the Yarmouth men in decked
vessels called “luggers,” from 20 to 50 tons burthen, having
three masts, and rigged with three lugsails, topsails, mizou,
foresail, and jib: the crew of the largest consisting of twelve
men and a boy, who are paid according to the quantity of fish
caught. Each ordinary vessel carries two hundred nets of 48
feet in length and 30 in depth, each having meshes of 1 inch
or 1⅛ inch, as usual in herring nets. Of these nets they shoot
one hundred at a time, reserving the other hundred for cases
of accident or mishap. When launched, each net is attached
by two seizings of 1½ inch rope, having a depth of 18 feet, to
a four-stranded (generally 4 inch) warp of 3600 feet in length;
this warp is made fast to a rope from the bow of the vessel,
which in stormy weather can be let out to ease the strain, to
the extent of 100 fathoms, or 600 feet. For each net there
are two buoys (4-gallon barrels) made fast to the warp, and
there are four buoys besides, to mark the distances, two for
the quarter and three-quarter stations, painted red and white
quarterly, one for the half distance or middle of the fleet,
painted half red and half white, and one for the extremity,
painted all white; each of them has painted on it the names
of the ship, master, owner, and port, in order that they may be
restored in case of breaking away during bad weather; and so
good an understanding exists upon this subject amongst the
fishermen, that the nets are always restored by the finder to
the owner upon payment of only 1s. for each net; and no one
must suffer a stray net to drift away; if seen, it must be taken
in. This fishery commences in the beginning of October, and
lasts little more than two months. The nets are shot after
the Dutch fashion, at sunset; but if the appearances are favourable,
they are taken in once or twice during the night,
and again at sunrise. 100 barrels of herrings are frequently
taken by these nets at a single haul, and 600 barrels may be
considered as a fair average fishing for one vessel during the
season. The number of decked vessels employed at Yarmouth
alone in the fishery is about 500.</p>

<p>Next, and likely from its steady increase soon to become
the first, is the Scotch fishery.</p>

<p>Like the Norwegian, every description of boat and net is
to be found employed amongst the Scottish islands, but the
most regularly employed vessels are open undecked boats, of
28 to 32 feet in length, or thereabouts, and 9 to 11 feet in
breadth, usually rigged with two masts and two sails. They
have on board from twelve to thirty nets of from 150 to 186
feet in length each, and from 20 to 31 feet in depth.</p>

<p>From the Report by the Commissioners of the British
Herring Fishery, of the fishery of 1838, year ending 5th April
1839, it appears that there were then engaged in the fishery
11,357 boats, decked and undecked, throughout England and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
Scotland, manned by 50,238 men and boys, and employing
85,573 persons in all, including coopers, packers, curers, and
labourers.</p>

<p>Of the entire number of vessels, about 9000 belonged to
Scottish ports.</p>

<p>The entire quantity of herrings exported amounted to
239,730½ barrels, of which 195,301 barrels were Scotch; and
of those exported, 149,926 barrels were sent to and disposed
of in Ireland.</p>

<p>The entire quantity of herrings taken by Scottish boats,
and cured both for home use and exportation, was 495,589
barrels; the total by English and Scotch 555,559¾ barrels;
but this return does not include the Yarmouth fishery, the
herrings there being always smoked, or made into what are
called <em>red herrings</em>.</p>

<p>We need not describe the Prussian and other methods, as
they resemble some one or other of those already mentioned.
Come we now to our own, which we have purposely reserved
to the last.</p>

<p>Amongst the fishermen of Ireland, the men of Kinsale have
long been the admitted leaders; and the Kinsale hookers are
celebrated throughout the nautical world as among the best
sea-boats that ever weathered a gale. They are half-decked
vessels, with one mast, carrying a fore and aft mainsail, foresail,
and jib, and are usually manned by four men and a boy.
They are seldom used in the herring fishery, being for the
most part confined to the deep-sea line fishery upon the
Nymph bank, where cod, ling, hake, haddock, turbot, plaice,
&amp;c., abound in such quantity that many persons affirm it to be
second only to the banks of Newfoundland. But the usual
mode of fishing for herrings, and which is adopted all along
the south, south-west, and west coast of Ireland, especially
at Valencia and Kenmare, is with the deep-sea seine. This
is formed sometimes for the express purpose, but frequently
by a subscription of nets. Fifteen men bring a drift-net each,
20 fathoms or 120 feet in length, and 5 fathoms or 30 feet in
depth; these are all joined together, five nets in length, and
three in depth, so that the whole seine is 600 feet in length
and 90 feet in depth, with a cork-rope (that is, a rope having
large pieces of cork attached to it at intervals) at the top,
and leaden sinkers attached to the foot-rope, which unites all
the nets at the bottom. Two warps of 60 fathoms each are
requisite, and there are brails (small half-inch ropes) attached
to the foot-rope, which are of use to haul upon, in order to
purse up the net and prevent the fish from escaping.</p>

<p>The seine is shot from a boat whilst it is being pulled round
the shoal of fish. All having been thrown over, the warp is
hauled upon until the net is brought into ten fathoms’ depth of
water, when the brails and foot-rope are hauled in, and the
fish is tucked into the largest boat. In this manner 80,000 to
100,000 herrings (about 100 barrels) may be taken at a haul.
But where the people are too poor to supply themselves with
nets or boats, many contrivances are made use of. For boats,
the <em>curragh</em>, made of wicker and covered with a horse’s skin,
or canvass pitched, is used, and often even this cannot be had;
sometimes the people load a horse with the nets, mount him
and swim him out, shooting the nets from his back; and for
nets, in many places, the people use their sheets, blankets, and
quilts, which they subscribe and sew together, often to the
number of sixty, and the fish thus taken are divided in due
proportion amongst the subscribers.</p>

<p>After the foreign statistics which we have laid before our
readers, they will doubtless expect us to inform them how
many vessels and what number of hands are <em>now</em> employed in
the Irish fishery. This, however, we are unable to do. The
Commissioners of the Herring Fishery have their jurisdiction
confined to Scotland and England, almost exclusively to Scotland,
the fishery of which is thriving under their fostering
care in a most surprising manner. By their judicious attention
to the encouragement of careful curing, and the distribution
of small aids in money to poor fishermen, the number of
boats employed in 1839 exceeded that of the former year
by 78; and the progressive increase in the fishery is fully exemplified
by the following table, showing the quantity of herrings
cured during the five years preceding the return now before
us:&mdash;</p>

<p>By this table it appears that the Scotch fishery has doubled
its amount in five years, without any description of bounty being
given. It may, however, be as well to state, before concluding
this paper, that it appears, by the Reports of the Irish
Commissioners, whose sittings terminated in the year 1830,
that during the time that Ireland possessed a Fishery Board,
the number of persons employed in the fishery had more than
doubled. At the time of the first appointment of Commissioners
of Irish Fisheries in 1819, the number of men employed
was estimated at 30,000. By the first return which they could
venture to pronounce accurate, being for the year ending 5th
April 1822, the number was 36,192 men; 5th April 1823,
the number was 44,892 men, being an increase of 8700;
at 5th April 1824, the number was 49,448, being an increase on
the preceding year of 4556; 5th April 1825, the number was
52,482, being an increase on the preceding year of 3034; and
the numbers went on regularly progressing every year during
the existence of the Board, until its termination, as the following
extract from the last Report will best exhibit. It is for
the year 1830, at which time the bounty had been reduced to
one shilling per barrel:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Commissioners have still the gratification to find,
from the returns made by the local inspectors, that the number
of fishermen still continues to experience a yearly increase.
The gross amount, as taken from the returns of the
preceding year, was 63,421 men. The gross amount, as taken
from the returns of the present year, is 64,771 men, being an
increase on the past year of 1350 men.”</p>

<p>By the same report it appeared that the number of decked
vessels was 345; tonnage 9810; men 2147&mdash;half-decked vessels
769; tonnage 9457; men 3852&mdash;row-boats 9522; men
46,212.</p>

<p>The quantity of herrings cured for bounty in the year
ending 5th April 1830, was 16,855 barrels, the bounty on
which was £842 15s.</p>

<p>The tonnage bounty paid to vessels engaged in the cod and
ling fishery was £829 10s; and the bounty on cured cod, &amp;c.
was £960.</p>

<p>There is not in the reports that we have seen any attempt
at estimating the quantity of herrings caught, which
is somewhat extraordinary, considering the accuracy with
which the number of fishermen, curers, coopers, &amp;c., was ascertained;
but the quantity cured is given above.</p>

<p>Whilst, however, the number of fishermen employed in the
fisheries generally, increased so very considerably during the
period that the Irish Fishery Board was in operation, it is an
extraordinary, and to us inexplicable fact, that the quantity
of herrings cured for bounty in any one season never exceeded
16,855 barrels, so that even the high bounty of 4s per barrel
was not sufficient to induce the Irish fishermen to cure their
herrings in a proper manner. In short, the fishery board, in
so far as the primary object of its formation was concerned,
was totally inoperative, and the people of this country were as
dependent then as now upon the Scotch curers for the requisite
supply of the staple luxury of the poorer classes.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say to what extent the fisheries may have
fallen off, if at all, in Ireland, since the abolition of the fishery
board; but as the quantity of salted herrings imported into
Ireland from Scotland has not materially increased since, it
may be presumed that as many herrings are caught and
cured now as at any former period.</p>

<p>The alleged decline of the Irish fisheries has by many been
attributed entirely to the withdrawal of the bounties and the
fishery board. But when we consider the exceedingly trifling
amount of bounty paid on herrings in any one year, the discontinuance
of so small a sum as £842 15s 7d (the amount in
1829-30) could not possibly have any perceptible influence
upon a branch of industry which gave employment to 75,366
persons.</p>

<p>Nor could the discontinuance of the grants made for harbours
and small loans to poor fishermen have produced any
material influence upon the fisheries, as the total amount advanced
in ten years for these two objects was only £39,508
18s 2d, or less than £4000 a-year.</p>

<p>There is then but one other point of view in which the withdrawal
of the fishery board could have operated injuriously,
namely, the absence of that supervision and authority in regulating
the fisheries which the officers of the board exercised
to a certain extent, and which in our opinion ought to have
been continued.</p>

<p>The various modes of curing herrings will form the subject
of a future article.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">SCRAPS FROM THE NORTHERN SCRIP.</h2>

<p>[The following specimens of the Icelandic Sagas have been closely translated
for the Irish Penny Journal, from the publications of the Royal Society
of Northern Antiquaries, Copenhagen.]</p>

<h3>NO. I.&mdash;KING OLAVE AND THE DEVIL.</h3>

<p>And now the enemy of the whole human race, the devil himself,
saw how his kingdom began to be laid waste, he who always
persecutes human nature, and he saw how much on the
other hand God’s kingdom prospered and increased; thereat
he now felt great envy, and he puts on the human form, because
he could so much the more easily deceive men, if he looked
like a man himself. It so happened that King Olave was on a
visit at Œgvald’s Ness,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> about the anniversary of our Lord
Jesus Christ’s nativity; and as all were regularly seated in
the evening, and preparations were making for the drinking
bout, and they were waiting until the royal table should be
covered, there came an old one-eyed man into the hall with a
silk hat on his head; he was very talkative, and could relate
divers kinds of things; he was led forward before the king,
who asked him the news, to which he replied, that he could
relate various matters about the ancient kings and their battles.
The king asked whether he knew who Œgvald was,
he whom the Ness was called after. He answered, “He
dwelt here on the Ness, and dearly loved a cow, so that she
would follow him wherever he led her, and he would drink
her milk; and therefore people that love cattle say that man
and cow shall go together. This king fought many a battle,
and once he strove with the king of Skorestrand; in that
battle fell many a man, and there fell also King Œgvald,
and he was afterwards buried aloft here on the Ness, and
his barrow will be found here a little way from the house;
in the other barrow lies the cow.” The drinking bout
was now held according to usage, and all the diversions
that had been appointed. Afterwards many went away to
sleep. Then the king had that old man called to him, and
he sat on the footstool by the king’s bed, and the king asked
him about many matters, which he explained well, and like an
experienced man. And when he had related much and explained
many things well, the king became constantly the more
desirous to hear him; he therefore staid awake a great part
of the night, and continued to ask him about many things.
At last the bishop reminded him in a few words that the
king should stop speaking with the man; but the king thought
he had related a part, but that another was still wanting. Far
in the night, however, the king at last fell asleep, but awoke
soon after, and asked whether the stranger was awake; he
did not answer. The king said to the watchers that they
should lead him up, but he was not found. The king then
stood up, had his cupbearer and cook called to him, and asked
whether any unknown man had gone to them when they were
preparing the guest-chamber. The head cook said, “There
came a little while ago, sire, a man to us, and said to me, as
I was preparing the meat for a savoury dish for you, ‘Why
do you prepare such meat for the king’s table as choice food
for him, which is so lean?’ I told him then to get me some
fatter and better meat, if he had any such. He said, ‘Come
with me, and I will show you some fat and good meat, which
is fit for a king’s table.’ And he led me to a house, and
showed me two sides of very fat flesh; and this have I prepared
for you, sire!” The king now saw it was a wile of the
devil, and said to the cook, “Take that meat now, and cast
it into the sea, that none may eat thereof; and if any one
tastes of it, he will quickly die. But whom do you suppose that
devil to have been, the stranger guest?” “We know not,”
said they, “who it is.” The king said, “I believe that
devil took upon himself Odin’s form.” According to the
king’s command the meat was carried out, and cast into the
sea; but the stranger was nowhere found, and search was
made for him round about the Ness, according to the king’s
commandment.&mdash;<cite>From Olave Tryggvason’s Saga.</cite></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
